                    Our company was founded in 2005 by adventure enthusiasts who wanted to share the thrill of white water rafting with the world.
                    Since then, we've grown into a leading provider of unforgettable rafting experiences. Whitewater rafting has its roots deep in history,
                    tracing back to the indigenous peoples of North America who navigated rivers and rapids in canoes for fishing and travel.
                    The spirit of adventure continued with explorers like Lewis and Clark in the early 1800s, who used wooden rafts and canoes
                    to map vast new territories.

                    In 1869, Major John Wesley Powell led a daring expedition down the Green and Colorado Rivers, facing treacherous rapids and unknown terrain.
                    His journey marked one of the first scientific explorations of whitewater rivers and laid the foundation for modern rafting.
                    The sport of whitewater rafting truly took off in the 1960s when surplus military rafts became available, and pioneers began outfitting commercial trips.
                    Since then, rafting has grown into a popular recreational activity enjoyed by millions worldwide, offering thrilling adventures
                    and a unique way to connect with nature.

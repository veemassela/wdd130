        <p>Hello, I am Victoria Massela. I live in Cape Town, South Africa. It really is a beautiful, although I would consider closer to 
            average when you are broke and luxurious when you have money. Anyways, programming was never my first choice. I wanted to go into 
            marketing, so I took a business course and realised it was not for me. Then I took a course on pythin and I really liked it. I hope I can develop my skills 
            and become a competent programmer. Some languages I can speak are English of course, Afrikaans, which is like African Dutch and a little bit of Portuguese. 
            I was learning Pinying and Korean, but i stopped about a year ago. Some of my hobbies include hiking up Table Mountain, pilates, baking, cooking and I am 
            trying to get back into reading.
          </p>
